VehicleAimGetAngle() to replace UnitPitch()

Fix dragging (left click + alt)

Working fine in MoP

Now provides proper pitch for unit instead of camera angle.

Thanks to akazik for pointing out the function addition (came in 3.0) and thanks to Blizz for adding it

A very simple mod that displays your current pitch. It is meant for mouse flyers so they can see their current pitch (+ve is angled up)

Alt+left click to move

No idea on its impact on CPU usage

Only display in flight

For those of you looking for a more direct solution to flying straight you might consider levelflight
